Autumn greetings! 👋🍄🍂

I am a Pediatric Nurse studying to become an ICT Engineer at LAB University of Applied Sciences. 
I am currently working on a course on the basics of IoT and embedded systems. I am especially interested in learning about coding. 

In my free time, you'll often find me riding bikes with friends 🚴‍♀️🚵‍♀️!
